# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?<br>

  I find myself forgetting the syntax of key:value pairs. For some reason that never stays in my head. I also struggled with objects as elements of an array.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?<br>
  
  I find myself taking the most helpful notes during class, but not so much during the homework considering it's all in writing. If I run across something that I do not understand, I am more likely to create a flashcard.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?<br>
  
  If it's syntax related--like I can't remember what a certain method is called, or how to use it--then I am more likely to use Google. But if it's a code problem I am just struggling to get working, I will keep trying on my own and use the errors that are raised to help me understand what I might be doing wrong.
